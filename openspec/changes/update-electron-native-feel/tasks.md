## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Audit global layout to disable default body scrolling, lock shell height, and limit text-selection to interactive content.
- [ ] Implement sticky footer + drag-region header/blank areas so the window remains draggable with hidden title bar.
- [ ] Update Tabs styling for light/dark parity (visible inactive labels, accent-colored active state) and ensure typography remains legible.
- [ ] Rebuild the AnimatedOrb component to render multiple rotating blurred circles with distributed floating job cards during scraping.
- [ ] Enforce fixed capture log panel height with internal scrolling and ensure other scrollable sections behave similarly.
- [ ] Validate UX on macOS (or simulated frameless window) confirming dragging, scrolling, and selection behaviors meet the spec.
