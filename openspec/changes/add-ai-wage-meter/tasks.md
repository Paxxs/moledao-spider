## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Update scraper progress payloads to accumulate approximate word counts per job and calculate GPT-4 pricing metadata.
- [x] 1.2 Propagate the new progress fields through preload/hooks/types so the renderer receives them without type errors.
- [x] 1.3 Add a localized "AI wage" card on the Main screen that shows word counts + USD cost with an animated pulse when the wage increases.
- [x] 1.4 Validate localization resources and run lint/tests (or manual verification) to ensure the UI renders correctly in all supported languages.
